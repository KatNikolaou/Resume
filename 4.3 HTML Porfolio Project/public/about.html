<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an ambitious and adaptable person with a mature and responsible approach to any task that i undertake, or any situation that i'm presented with. I have an eye for detail which enhances my problem-solving skills.</p>
<p>My work experience enhaced my skills in communication and how to work as a team player. Trained me to thrive in fast-paced and multidisciplinary situations, working under pressure and keep my good temper.</p>
<p>My hobbies are actually my computer, since i am an introvert person. I tend to spend my off work hours on a computer, discovering and learning new things, or playing games with friends, working out once in a while when i don't feel physically exchausted from work.</p>
<p>Generally i like to spent my time at home cooking, i'm a food lover, watching tv series and documentaries. I value my family and i prefer to spent my time home with them or friends.</p>
